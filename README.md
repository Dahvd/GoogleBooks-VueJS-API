# Google Books Web App with Vue.js
The Vue App contains the functionality to search through books while displaying 20 books per page.  Upon clicking the next button, 
each page will display 20 new books until there are no more books to be displayed.  Any part of the book that is undefined will not be displayed.

A template for each book is used which comes from the component located in bookDisplay.js
Additional data fields for the book (the description and the page count) are also listed.


The vue app is defined in main.js with the bookDisplay component located in the components folder.
